        <p>Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop
             computer programs including websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses
              Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation
               Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed
                code.</p>
        <p>Also known as a terminal or computer console, a console is a combination of a display monitor and an
             input device, typically a keyboard and/or mouse. It allows users to input commands and receive 
             visual output from a computer or computer system. It is connected to another computer, server, or 
             mainframe and is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer.</p>
